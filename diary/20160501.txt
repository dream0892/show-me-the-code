python-docx is hosted on PyPI, so installation is relatively simple, and just depends on what installation utilities you have installed.

python-docx may be installed with pip if you have it available:

pip install python-docx
python-docx can also be installed using easy_install, although this is discouraged:

easy_install python-docx
If neither pip nor easy_install is available, it can be installed manually by downloading the distribution from PyPI, unpacking the tarball, and running setup.py:

tar xvzf python-docx-{version}.tar.gz
cd python-docx-{version}
python setup.py install
python-docx depends on the lxml package. Both pip and easy_install will take care of satisfying those dependencies for you, but if you use this last method you will need to install those yourself.
